Pyber Trends

Based on the analyzed data we see that Pyber services are more popular in urban than in suburban or rural cities.
This trend could mostly be explain by larger population concentration in urban cities and therefore a bigger need for transportation services.

Due to the popularity of Pyber we also see a large amount of drivers in the urban cities. 
What we can't tell from this data is if the demand is meet with the current amount of drivers.

Based on the Ride Sharing Data graph we see on average 25 rides on urban cities with fares between $20-$30. 
There is a significant difference in price and number of rides when comparing to suburban and rural cities. 
This can be explain by a longer distances and a lower supply of drivers for those areas.
